# Sliding Window Visualization

An interactive visualization tool for understanding sliding window attention patterns across 1D, 2D, and 3D spaces. This tool helps you intuitively explore how tokens are distributed in 3D sparse attention mechanisms and design effective sparse attention patterns for your models.
